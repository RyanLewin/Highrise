A city builder game with extra twists

A project made at university alongside a couple of fellow students. 
We were given a project to get together and make a game, we spent a couple of weeks coming up with an
outline of an idea and so far have come up with this. I have contributed to a lot of the coding for 
building and Emergency events that occur, such as illness, robberies and earthquakes.

When an illness or robbery occurs, the happiness of the people goes down and to get it back up
you need to use the right vehicle to help out, e.g. An ambulance to pick up the ill or a police car to
control the robbery situation.
